I just released the beta version of a project I've been working on, the Rat Board. You can [click here](/ratboard/) to check it out. The Rat Board is a web-based chat client with a terminal-esque look to it. I've wanted something like this, so I made it. That's usually how my personal projects happen.

When you first open the Rat Board, you will be prompted to choose a name. Next, you will be prompted to choose a "room." Simply type `/join someroomname` to join a chat room. You can join a different chat room by using that command again. The title of the web page will indicate which room you are in.

One of the features most specific to Rat Board is the ability to post a link to an image or youtube video. By simply pasting the link and hitting enter, your message will be automatically formatted to embed the video or image into the chat.

If you run into any problems or have any suggestions or comments, feel free to [contact me](/contact)!
