Elon Musk, the real world Tony Stark, has revealed his plans for a transportation device called the [Hyperloop](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/hyperloop). The sketches and idea have a clear scent of the future.

The advertised claim is LA to SF in 35 minutes - 28 people per pod. One of the more brilliant parts about the idea, however, is the fact that these "tubes," that if built, would set up a framework for electric car charging stations. If the Hyperloop were built, it would trigger a revolution in transportation. Assuming that the technology is successful, I believe that we would quickly see Hyperloop tubes built between big cities. Airplane travel would sharply decline, and hopefully, in that near future, the use of electric cars would become far more feasible.

I'm eager to see what the future holds.
