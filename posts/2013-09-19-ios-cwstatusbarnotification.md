title: iOS - CWStatusBarNotification
excerpt: ![CWStatusBarNotification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification/master/screenshots/demo.gif) Several applications I've seen have notifications that move most of the content down and extend the navigation toolbar.

It makes a lot more sense to put notifications of this sort in the status bar, as it does not disrupt the main content view.

Several applications I've seen have notifications that move most of the content down and extend the navigation toolbar. I've always found that to be slightly annoying. So I decided to make a quick library to create notifications in the status bar. It makes a lot more sense to put notifications of this sort in the status bar, as it does not disrupt the main content view.

You can find more details about this library [on my GitHub page](https://github.com/cezarywojcik/CWStatusBarNotification). It's available on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) by using:

    pod 'CWStatusBarNotification', '~> 1.0.1'.
