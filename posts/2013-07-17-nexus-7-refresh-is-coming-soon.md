[According to AndroidCenteral](http://www.androidcentral.com/new-nexus-7-pics-video-specs), the Nexus 7 Refresh is coming soon. The main changes seem to be spec boosts and a rear-facing 5 megapixel camera. Additionally, the new Nexus 7 might be looking at a significant RAM upgrade.

> We're also possibly looking at a ridiculously whopping 4 gigabytes of DDR3L RAM. (Though we're not 100 percent sure on that, 2GB wouldn't surprise us at all, and, again, written specs on stuff like this get messed up all the time.)

I had a Nexus 7 towards the start of the year, before I traded it in for an iPad. Android tablets still, unfortunately, do not have the same quality and quantity of applications compared to the iOS platform. The Nexus 7 still remains a remarkable device given its $200 price tag. [Some leaks](http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-7-sequel-pricing-leaks-16gb-229-32gb-269) suggest that the base price for the new Nexus 7 will be $230 as opposed to the current $200. If the Nexus 7 has the rumored 1080p screen, this pricing seems pretty fair.

The tablet is most likely to launch soon after the [July 24 Google Event](http://www.androidcentral.com/google-schedules-android-event-july-24)
