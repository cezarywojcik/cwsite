I ran into an interesting App Store *review technique* that I had not heard of before, which caused the delay. Obviously, the CorBus app is location-specific. It shows bus stops that are near the user's location. This means that anywhere outside of Corvallis, this app will not show any stops in its default view. I was kind of wondering how Apple would go about testing this since they probably do most of the review work out of Cupertino, or at least, definitely *not* anywhere near Corvallis.

I mentioned in the Review Notes portion of my submission that CorBus will only work in Corvallis because I assumed that Apple had some way of spoofing locations as this kind of issue must come up fairly often. What I got instead was a "metadata rejection". The official reason for the rejection was that my review notes need to include a video of the app when it *is* working. I had not heard of this kind of requirement before, though to be fair, I haven't looked over all of Apple's official guidelines line by line. There was no place to upload a video; Apple simply wanted me to provide them some kind of link or description to get to it.

I filmed a quick video from my iPad and uploaded it to a YouTube account. I linked the video in the Review Notes, and that seemed to be enough because the app was approved today. It does make me wonder, however, what kind of location-specific easter eggs or other features I can hide from reviewers.
