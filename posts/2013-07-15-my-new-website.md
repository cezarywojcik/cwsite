![New Website](/img/blog/newsite.png)
I just remade my website from scratch. The site is now faster and more visually appealing. You can see a comparison of the two sites above. On the left is the old version of the site, and on the right is the new version.

The first change I made when redesigning the website is the color scheme. I prefer these dark, royal red tones to the blue tint I had before.

I also made this website more mobile-friendly through the use of media queries to create responsive CSS. I made sure to keep mobile devices in mind when redesigning my website.

I used [Slim 2](http://www.slimframework.com/news/version-2) for URL routing and [TWIG](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) for templating. This makes the site faster and easier to update. The source code of the website is available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/cezarywojcik/mywebsite).

Finally, I added [Google Code Prettify](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/) so that I can post code in this blog in the future. Here's an example:

    while(true) {
      alert('Hello, World!');
    }
