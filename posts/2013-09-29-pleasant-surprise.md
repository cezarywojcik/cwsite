I was already prepared to be waiting until October 21st to get my iPhone 5s gold. I was very pleasantly surprised when I got this message in my email today:

How did it happen so quickly? Did Apple actually have more golds than they let on? There have been some theories that gold iPhones were purposefully in low stock. I'm not sure whether these are true, but I *am* happy to have my new iPhone far sooner than expected.
