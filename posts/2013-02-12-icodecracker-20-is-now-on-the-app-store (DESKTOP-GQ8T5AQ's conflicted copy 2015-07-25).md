After a bit of a wait, iCodeCracker 2.0 has finally been approved to the App Store! This new version includes GameCenter support, a new look, and an In App Purchase that can be used to remove the ads.

My thoughts on the changes in iCodeCracker 2.0 are below.

The first thing I did is change the ad vs no ad model from the outdated paid app and free app version to the more modern in-app purchase model. There will be only one iCodeCracker app and it will offer an in-app purchase to remove the ads.

I also added GameCenter support to the game. Ideally, I wanted for GameCenter to track the average score, but that does not seem to be supported currently. It's something I'll have to continue to look into.

The final change to the app is aesthetical. I redesigned the interface to be simpler and have less glows everywhere. I also made the interface strechable so that it streches to fit the iPhone 5's bigger screen.
